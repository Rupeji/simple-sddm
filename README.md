   ```

2. Then move it as follows:

   ```bash
   sudo mv ~/simple-sddm /usr/share/sddm/themes/
   ```

## Configure

Edit the `/usr/share/sddm/themes/name/theme.conf` (with any text editor with **raised** privileges), so that it looks like this:

- By default, it is configured with 24H format. You can change to AM/PM variant by editing the theme.conf
```bash
sudo nano /usr/share/sddm/themes/simple-sddm/theme.conf  # use any text editor with raised privileges
```
